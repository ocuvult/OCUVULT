It is impossible to lose Ocuvult stored inside <br>
of Ocuvult's user registration system. Even <br>
if the software and hardware that builds <br>
Ocuvult is destroyed, the creator will <br>
rebuild the user account blockchain <br>
with the original amount of Ocuvult <br>
held by every user.

Ocuvult is as decentralized as it's users make it.<br>
You want to create a wallet and install it on a toaster?<br>
Great! just submit the executable and we will provide a<br>
recieving address for the wallet and Ocuvult to compensate<br>
you for your contributions. Ocuvult that leaves<br>
the user account blockchain becomes the responsibility<br>
of the owner of the receiving external wallet and cannot<br>
be sent back to the user account blockchain. There <br>
is no guarantee that your wallet and the amount<br>
you had in it will be restored if it is<br>
compromised.<br>

  Every send order that you make from your account is confirmed<br>
