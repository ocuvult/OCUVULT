It is impossible to lose Ocuvult stored inside <br>
of Ocuvult's user registration system blockchain. Even <br>
if the software and hardware that builds <br>
Ocuvult is destroyed, the creator will <br>
rebuild the user account blockchain <br>
with the original amount of Ocuvult <br>
held by every user.

Ocuvult is as decentralized as it's users make it.<br>
You want to create a wallet and install it on a toaster?<br>
Great! just submit the executable and we will provide a<br>
receiving address for the wallet and Ocuvult to pay<br>
you for your contributions. Ocuvult that leaves the user <br>
account blockchain becomes the responsibility<br>
of the owner of the receiving external wallet and cannot<br>
be sent back to the user account blockchain. There <br>
is no guarantee that external wallets and the amount<br>
of Ocuvult on them will be restored if they are<br>
compromised.<br>

  Every send order that you make from your account is confirmed<br>
  by you through email. This makes it impossible for your ocuvult<br>
  to be stolen if your account is compromised.
